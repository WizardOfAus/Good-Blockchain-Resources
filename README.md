## How to get started

There are several 'introductions' on can follow on how to 'get started'. These introductions tend to follow a path that depends on what one wishes to get to start on whether it is a hands-on technical approach, an investing approach, an academic approach etc. This guide and the resources are more specifically focused on the former with a sprinkle of high level explanations (for the newbies) and a small aside to investing as well.
